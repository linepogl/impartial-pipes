## p_merge

Partial function to merge two iterables.
 - If `$preserveKeys` is `false`, the result is a 0-indexed iteration.
 - If `$preserveKeys` is `true`, the keys of the two iterables are preserved. If the same key exists in both iterables, only the first occurrence is used.

### Examples

```
[1, 2]
|> p_merge([3, 4])
//= [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
```
[1, 2]
|> p_merge([3, 4], preserveKeys: true)
//= [1, 2]
```
```
['a' => 1, 'b' => 2]
|> p_merge(['b' => 22,'c' => 3])
//= [1, 2, 22, 3]
```
```
['a' => 1,'b' => 2]
|> p_merge(['b' => 22,'c' => 3], preserveKeys: true)
//= ['a' => 1,'b' => 2,'c' => 3]
```
