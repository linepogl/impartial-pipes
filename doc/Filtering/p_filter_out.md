## p_filter_out

Partial function to filter elements out of an iterable, using a predicate.

### Syntax
```
p_filter_out(
  callable(TValue[, TKey]): bool
  [, preserveKeys: bool = false]
)
```

### Examples
Filter out even numbers from an array
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
|> p_filter_out(static fn (int $x) => $x % 2 === 0);
//= [1, 3, 5]
```
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
|> p_filter_out(static fn (int $x) => $x % 2 === 0, preserveKeys: true);
//= [0 => 1, 2 => 3, 4 => 5]
```
Filter out elements with keys shorter than three characters
```
['a' => 1, 'bb' => 2, 'ccc' => 3]
|> p_filter_out(static fn (int $x, string $k) => strlen($k) < 3);
//= [3]
```
```
['a' => 1, 'bb' => 2, 'ccc' => 3]
|> p_filter_out(static fn (int $x, string $k) => strlen($k) < 3, preserveKeys: true);
//= ['ccc' => 3]
```
