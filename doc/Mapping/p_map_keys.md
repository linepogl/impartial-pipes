## p_map_keys

Returns a partial function that maps the keys of an iterable using a projection. It preserves the values.

Attention: it is possible to have repeated keys in the result, use u_unique_keys to eliminate them.

### Syntax

```php
p_map_keys(
  callable(TValue[, TKey]): TNewKey
)
```

### Examples
Map keys by value projection
```php
['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3]
|> p_map_keys(static fn (int $value) => $value * $value)
//= [1 => 1, 4 => 2, 9 => 3]
```
```php
['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 2]
|> p_map_keys(static fn (int $value) => $value * $value)
//= [1 => 1, 4 => 2, 4 => 4], the key 4 is repeated, use u_unique_keys to eliminate it
```
Map keys by value and key projection
```php
['a' => 1, 'bb' => 2, 'ccc' => 3]
|> p_map_keys(static fn (int $value, string $key) => strlen($key))
//= [1 => 1, 2 => 2, 3 => 3]
```
```php
['a' => 1, 'bb' => 2, 'cc' => 3]
|> p_map_keys(static fn (int $value, string $key) => strlen($key))
//= [1 => 1, 2 => 2, 2 => 3], the key 2 is repeated, use u_unique_keys to eliminate it
```
